# Network modelling of the barrel cortex

Master's project done under the supervision of Prof. Carl Petersen and Prof. Wulfram Gerstner at the EPFL, Spring 2018.

## Things to do 

-- Work out the biology of the barrel cortex and see if that makes sense to you.
-- Add noise
-- PSTH and other experimental calculations
-- Repeating experiments from Nolte (2018).

## Update
-- Worked out parameters, wrote my own simulation protocol, changed diagrams, shifted to Brian2
